The active web page will get a dashed border, along with any included frames or iframes.\r\n- Click to select page elements of interest.\r\n- Right-click the page under testing to access the keyword context menu.\r\n- Select the menu options and test steps will be added.\r\n- Use the ESC key to clear the selections, while keeping the selection mode on.\r\n- To fill and check forms you may select any element that includes the form elements of interest, not necessarily the form element.\r\n- For frame related keywords you may select an element that includes the frame of interest or any element inside the frame.\r\n- Use the settings window to change the locator preferences and the options for variable creation and usage.\r\n- You may reference resource files, with high level keywords, in the *Settings* section. Make sure you use the full path.\r\n- You may use any [RF Standard Library](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/TestLibraries) (OperatingSystem, String, etc). Just include it on the *Settings* section.\r\n- To run the current test script just click on the play button.\r\n- The test script can be saved to a .txt file and reused later, on FireRobot or another IDE.\r\n- Linux and Mac OS X users: You must open the test report manually, after the test is run. Also, you must most record the test scripts with the .txt extension explicitly.\r\n\r\nCheck the demonstration video at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPjS75jhDMw).\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer:** This tool is being released publicly because it is believed to have reached a stage where it can be helpful. However, it is still a 'young' application, with some known (and possibly unknown) limitations.\r\nPlease provide feedback at the [issues page](https://github.com/joao-carloto/FireRobot/issues). \r\nBugs, new features, small improvements, all are welcome. They will be addressed when possible.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
